# bomberman
Goofy script that prints discrepancies between text files. Used in the binary bomb CS 220 project at BU; it wasn't as helpful as I would've liked, but it did help me pass the first phase. It could be used in other situations, too.

The first update to this program was to add user input, so I wouldn't have to re-code the input files every time I wanted to switch.

I have no plans to update this program any further.
